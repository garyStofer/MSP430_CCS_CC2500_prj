This is the folder with the Workspace for CCs -- it contains the two projects. 
The "Workspace" is stored in a subfolder named ".metadata". An eclipse workspace can only 
be opened from within Eclipse itself by using the menu "File/Switch Workplace".
There is no file extension mechanism that ellows you to open en eclipse session directly
via a click on a file from the windows explorer !!

The projects contained within the workspace have to be at or below the folder where the "".metadata" folder lives.
the the workspace path is used in the project build options to refere to pathcs outside of the project folder.

The folder "Common" is used by both/all the projects within the workspace. It is included by the projects 
as a "linked" folder. A linked folder isd estblished in Eclipse by using: "File/New Folder" and then under Advanced choose "linked". 
Linked folders loose their link when a project is moved around on the FS and have then be re-established by relinking it.

The include directories outside of the local source path are added to the build by entering them under 
"Buil Properties/Tool_settings/Include options"  and look like this :"${workspace_loc:}/../Components\bsp".
all folders in the simpliciti filestructure that have include files need be listed. 
Each build Configuration in exlipse has it's own set of data -- so you have to duplicate this include for debug and release


The Simpliciti source files have to be individually linked into a local project folder. i.e. "SimplicitiComponets".
Only a subset of the source files of the simpliciti stack must linked since some files are sourced in by 
these top level files via #include.

 The following source files need so be linked:
	Components/bsp/bsp.c
	Components/mrfi/mrfi.c
	Components/nwk -- All .c files
	Components/nwk_app -- All .c files

The links will brake when the projects or the sipliciti components are moved relative to the project
