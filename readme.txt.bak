This folder contains the eclipse projects for the Ti - simplicity based applications for 
the AOA sensor and AOA sensor display.  The workspace metafile for the two build projects is located 
in ..../SimpliciTI_fromVM\AOA_LED_DSIP. 

Aslo under .../Examples there is a workspace metafile that includes a project Simple_peer_to_peer that can be used 
to demontrate a simple connection between two nodes. Other examples for the source could be added to this workspace.

The workspaces are opened with CodeComposer Studio 4 (CCS4) and are built with the internal builder and compiled with the cl430 compiler
provided by CCS4. Download will take place vis the TI USB adapter called "FET" that is part of the ez430-RF2500 kit.

See file note on CCS Workspace.txt and "notes about Path locations" for  the issues around fixed path loations !

Working installation of IDE and project can be found on old DELL 2400 D:\MSP430_CCS_CC2500_prj\SimpliciTI_fromVM\
